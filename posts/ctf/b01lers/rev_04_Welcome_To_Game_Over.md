Running the file at first sight we get some output:
```
m3dsec@local:~/b01lers.com/rev/04_Welcome_To_Game_Over$ ./game-over 

sharkboy@gameover > ./getemail.sh
I was fired.                          
I know.
I hacked into the O.S.S. data files and saw the news.
It was probably my fault, I suppose.
I am sorry.
```

after reversing the program using ghidra we can spot the main function, that contain :

```c
void main(void)

{
  puts("\nsharkboy@gameover > ./getemail.sh");
  fflush(stdout);
  flashprint("**** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM CARMEN ****",700,5);
  funprint(
           "I was fired.\nI know.\nI hacked into the O.S.S. data files and saw the news.\nIt wasprobably my fault, I suppose.\nI am sorry."
           ,300);
  _my_little_thumbling("flag{welc0me_to_th3_game<FIND_THE_REST_OF_THE_FLAG_IN_FUNCTION_NAMES>}");
  return;
}
```
we can spot the 1st part of the flag `flag{welc0me_to_th3_game`, the rest was the function name `_my_little_thumbling`

and, we got the flag !!

`flag{welc0me_to_th3_game_my_little_thumbling`
